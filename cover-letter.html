                    <h2>Entry-Level Cover Letter</h2>
                    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
                    <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in potential career opportunities within your organization.</p>
                    <p>As a final-year Bachelor of Information Technology student, I am still actively studying while developing my technical skills and knowledge. With a passion for technology, I am eager to contribute my current skills and the experience I will further gain along the way, to a dynamic and innovative team.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my studies, I have gained knowledge in software development, web application design, and system architecture, using technologies such as Java, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and JSP/Servlets. I am particularly enthusiastic about creating efficient and user-friendly solutions.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my academic work, I have completed the Salesforce Trailhead Ranger coursework, which has deepened my understanding of CRM systems and workflow. I have also had the opportunity to work collaboratively in groups on multiple projects and assignments, which has enhanced my teamwork and communication skills.</p>
                    <p>I am currently awaiting feedback from my campus regarding an LPR subject, which I may need to either rewrite in January or retake part-time next year over the weekends. While this might delay my graduation, I am committed to overcoming these challenges and remain focused on my long-term goal of becoming a proficient IT professional.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.</p>
