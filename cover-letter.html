                    <p>To whom this may concern,</p>
                    <p>I finished all of my subjects in 2024, except for 1 I still have to redo this year. The subject will be done over the period of three weeks which I am still uncertain about the date and time and am awaiting a response from the campus. It will either be in the morning or afternoon. 
                    But what I can say, with a passion for technology, I am eager to contribute my current skills and the experience I will further gain along the way, to a dynamic and innovative team.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my studies, I have gained knowledge in software development, web application design, and more.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my academic work, I have completed the Salesforce Trailhead Ranger coursework during Covid, which has deepened my understanding of CRM systems and workflow. I have also had the opportunity to work collaboratively in groups on multiple projects and assignments, which has enhanced my teamwork and communication skills.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to look through my website and reading this letter.</p>
